#### The What
*PolyPhy* is an unconventional toolkit for reconstructing **continuous networks** out of sparse 2D or 3D data. Such data can be defined as collections of discrete points, or a continuous sparse scalar field. *PolyPhy* produces a **scalar density field** that defines the recovered network structure. With the help of **GPU-accelerated simulation and visualization**, *PolyPhy* provides domain experts an interactive way to reconstruct any geometric data with an underlying network structure.

#### The How


#### The Who


#### The Where
The Universe, of course. But especially the former Creative Coding Lab and the [Open Source Program Office](https://ospo.ucsc.edu/) at the [University of California in Santa Cruz](https://ucsc.edu). On the Internet it lives on [polyphy.io](https://polyphy.io/) and the associated GitHub repositories below.

#### The When
Now. The when is now. Everything that happens now is happening now. - When will then be now? - Soon.
