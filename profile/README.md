*PolyPhy* is an unconventional toolkit for reconstructing **continuous networks** out of sparse 2D or 3D data. Such data can be defined as collections of discrete points, or a continuous sparse scalar field. *PolyPhy* produces a **scalar density field** that defines the recovered network structure. With the help of **GPU-accelerated simulation and visualization**, *PolyPhy* provides domain experts an interactive way to reconstruct any geometric data with an underlying network structure.
